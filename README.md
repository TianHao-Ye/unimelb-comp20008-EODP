Introduction
This project is designed to give you practice at solving some practical data science tasks. You
will need to implement and evaluate a data linkage system and a classication system using
sound data science principles. We intentionally do not prescribe the exact steps required as
a key part of the assessment is to evaluate your ability to exercise your own judgement in
deciding how to solve these practical data science problems, rather than simply implement-
ing a pre-dened algorithm. This is a big part of any real-world data science task, as there
are usually many approaches that can be taken and many irregularities in the data that are
impossible to exhaustively predene in a task description. A data scientist needs to be able
to select the best approach for resolving these issues and justify it in order for their results
to be convincing.

For this project, you will perform a data linkage on two real-world datasets (Part 1) and
explore dierent classication algorithms (Part 2).

Part 1 - Data Linkage (12 marks)
Abt and Buy both have product databases. In order to perform joint market research they
need to link the same products in their databases. Therefore the research team has manually
linked a subset of the data in order to build a linkage algorithm to automate the remaining
items to be linked. This manually linked data is what you will base your work on in this
assignment. However the real dataset is unknown to you, as it would be reality and this
unknown data is what you will be assessed on.

Part 2 - Classication (13 marks)

Each year, the World Bank publishes the World Development Indicators which provide high
quality and international comparable statistics about global development and the ght against
poverty [1]. As data scientists, we wish to understand how the information can be used to
predict average lifespan in dierent countries. To this end, we have provided the world.csv
le, which contains some of the World Development Indicators for each country and the
life.csv le containing information about the average lifespan for each country (based on
data from the World Health Organization) [2]. Each data le also contains a country name,
country code and year as identiers for each record. These may be used to link the two
datasets but should not be considered features.
